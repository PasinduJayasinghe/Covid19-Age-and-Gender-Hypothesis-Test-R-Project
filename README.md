Current report showing that death rate of older people is higher than younger people in Corona virus.Also some reports showing that mens have higher death rate than women.Here i tried to prove that hypothesis by applying t test to means of age of people who died and people who survived and means of mens who died and womens who died.Code is written in R Language.
Here i included the dataset i used to do the project
